A zero-truncated version  applies in situations where  the number of trials becomes known through the process itself, hence items without a single successful trial are unknown to the researcher.  The package further provides functions for the related geometric distribution, as well as a maximum likelihood function.\nLicense: GPL-3\nDepends: logitnorm\n",
