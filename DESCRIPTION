Title: (zero- truncated) logit-normal binomial distribution functions

Description: The logit-normal binomial distribution extends the binomial distribution by a logit-normal prior to account for unobserved variance between draws. A zero-truncated version  applies in situations where  the number of trials becomes known through the process itself, hence items without a single successful trial are unknown to the researcher.  The package further provides functions for the related geometric distribution, as well as a maximum likelihood function.
